This is the course projects for Java Programming: Principles of Software Design on Coursera

The files in this repository by itself won't compile. You need to provide external libraries "edu.duke" and "org.apache.commons.csv" for the code to work. These libraries can be found using a google search. 

It is tricky to use the audit option on Coursera, because the website will block you from submiting certain assingments, which are essential to complete one session in order to move on to the next session. Instead of completing each session, you just click on the Next button on the web page to move on to the next session. I believe this is a bug that Coursera didn't know of yet. They should've put a session completion check on the excution of that script on clicking the Next button. Anyway, that's how to advance into the next session when you are auditing a course. Happy hacking!

Personally, I don't like the teaching style of this course. But this online course is the best I can find so far, so I guess I will just keep on moving before I find something nicer. The instructors are trying to be funny, and turned out to be affected and unnatural. One more thing: I think if the instructor is not attractive or not good looking, they should hide behind the slides or use a cartoon figure instead.
